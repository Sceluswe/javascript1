1. Fix the style so that buttons occupy one row each.
2. Remove the previous question when displaying the new question.
3. Display something new in test in order to make sure that the next test will execute when questions finishes.
4. IT DOES NOT WORK! Javascript is restless. How do I avoid that?
Gotta rethink. Test has to decide the flow of the entire application. All other modules must simply provide necessary information to create the flow.
Follow the teachers module structure and make displayQuestion() public along with the other.

1. Create displayNextQuestion() for simple usage.
What I need the questions module to do is provide data. Create the questions. Record the number of correct answers.
Create answerQuestion function that makes the test go from one test to the next.
